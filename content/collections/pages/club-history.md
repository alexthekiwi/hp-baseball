            text: "Baseball is a relatively new sport in NZ starting just a little under 20 years ago with mainly senior-aged players. We were one of the founding clubs at this time with a Senior team. In 1993 the club expanded to include youth baseball. This provided depth and longevity to the HP story and helped make it NZ's premier Baseball Club."

            text: "Currently, Kyle Glogoski is working his way through the minor league farm teams of the Philadelphia Phillies, having signed a professional baseball contract in 2017. In 2019, Kyle has been tearing up the lower baseball farm leagues, earning a mid-season promotion to the high-A team. Kyle started his baseball at HP, and continues to work out with the Senior teams during his off season. In the 2018/19 Kyle was one of a number of HP Hawks to don the teal of the Auckland Tuatara, New Zealand's first professional baseball club, competing in the Australian Baseball League. He dominated in his Phillies mandated limited innings for the Club, becoming one of the stars of the Tuatara's inaugural season."

Scott said this was his "dream‚Äù, so if you work at it your dreams can come true.'
