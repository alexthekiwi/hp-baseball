Baseball requires parents to participate so that a team can run effectively, this means that club members may be asked to volunteer to do tuck shop duty, help out at working bees, you may be asked to coach, or manage or help score for your team. We provide support if you are willing to take on any one of these roles. Experience has shown that parental participation can enhance the enjoyment of the sport for your children.'
